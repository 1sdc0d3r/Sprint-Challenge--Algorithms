#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - This is because it doesn't matter what int a is, it will only run the operations 1 += as a increases

b) n^log(n) - This is because the for loop is a Olog(n) and the while loop is also O(n). when you put those together its n^log(n)

c) O(n) - This is a linear function. As bunnies increase it still only runs a single function as bunnies increase

## Exercise II

height of building is n
num of eggs not an issue
if floor => f = broken egg
if floor < f = not broken egg

do a for loop for hight of building,
if egg breaks, return f = i
else i++

runtime complexity: o(n)
